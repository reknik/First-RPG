# First-RPG
Prototype of an RPG game.

This game is inspired from the flash game series Hands of War, it's written in Lua using the love2D framework alongside libraries such as Bump, Anim8 and STI.
Please be advised that even though it's public it doesn't have comments as the code is not running too complex.
